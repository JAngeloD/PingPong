This was a fun project I challenged myself to improve my understanding of low level game development using SFML as the framework and C++ as the underlying language.
This main goal for this project was to use the knowledge I've gained for future game dev projects
<br>

In this challenge, I'm only allowed to reference the official documentation for SFML. Anything regarding to C++ syntax and functions I can use whatever resource to 
help me. I didn't have any references on implementation, structure, or advanced methods to improve performance which is why this project has so many things I can still 
improve on.

Overall challenging but very useful
